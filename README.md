# Campus_Navigation

Since the root folder of the project is pretty big(1.12 GB), I have shared the google drive link to the folder.

•Built a AR based navigation application using Unity, Vuforia Engine and C# in under 24 hours without using any external API or SDK.
•The application consists of two modes-
1.AR Mode-When facing the phone camera on a specific locations in the college, it shows the directions
and places we can go.
2.GPS Mode-Fetches the latitudes and longitudes of the location of the user and using calculations written in C# scripts, accurately tells the places as the user reaches them.

This project won my team the first prize in the NMIT Hackathon.
